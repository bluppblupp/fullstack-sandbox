# Sellpy Sandbox -- Niklas's Fork

Welcome to the Sellpy Sandbox environment
that has been updated by me!

## Prerequisites

NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Getting started

### To start the backend:

- Navigate to the backend folder
- Run 'npm ci'
- Run 'npm start'

### To start the frontend:

- Navigate to the frontend folder
- Run 'npm ci'
- Run 'npm start'

A browsertab will automatically open and load the app.

## Assignment

Your assignment is to improve this todo list application. At the moment the application is simple and can only create and remove todos.
As is, nothing is persisted in the server. As a result all state is cleared when refreshing the page!
Below follows one main task and 4 additional tasks. Your assignment is to complete the main task together with at least 2 out of 4 of the additional tasks.
If you feel constrained by time (which is totally fine!), prioritize quality over quantity.

### Main Task

- [x] Persist the todo lists on the server. Persisting in a database is not required. (Simple js structures on the server is fine). If you do go for an actual DB (again not required), be sure to include instructions of how to get it up and running.

### Additional tasks

- [x] Don't require users to press save when an item is added/edited in the todo list. (Autosave functionality) :tada:
- [x] Make it possible to indicate that a todo is completed. :tada:
- [x] Indicate that a todo list is completed if all todo items within are completed. :tada:
- [ ] Add a date for completion to todo items. Indicate how much time is remaining or overdue.
